# MIMEfix
The code of this repo. does not work after OS X 10.9 because this is an archive. 

MIMEfix is a plug-in Mail.app on MacOS X. Mail.app sometime fails to decode Japanese filename of attached documents due to incompatibility of MIME format. This mis-decode discourages us to use Mail.app. MIMEfix may correct this glitch on Mail.app.

Note: Since Mail.app bundled newly released MacOSX 10.9 is not compatible with the traditional frameworks, MIMEfix requires a lot of changes. Also, the filename issues likely does not happen, at least within my sample. MIMEfix contribution will not be large at this time. So, I decided to postpone the program update. If I am aware other filename issues, I will consider the update.
